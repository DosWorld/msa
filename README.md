# msa
x86 assembler for DOS

I wrote this assembler in 2000-2001, and by request I now publish it under the
MIT license.

Please see `original/doc/doc.txt` for the original documentation, although
notice that the license conditions and contact information have now been
updated.

Note that this software is antique and entirely unsupported.
